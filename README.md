# Poplin Inspector
At its core, the [Poplin Project](http://projectpoplin.org) seeks to promote modern, modular Medicaid IT systems by improving communication between those systems.  Poplin Inspector verifies that Medicaid IT systems are conforming to the data standards set out in the Poplin service definitions.

# Environment Setup
Ensure that the following environment variables are set when the machine is created:
- `POPLIN_INSPECTOR_NAME`: A human name given to this instance of the Poplin Inspector to distinguish between different deployments (e.g., Alice, Bob, Christine, Daniel, etc.)
- `RABBITMQ_URL`
  - Inside the OpenShift cluster, set to the OpenShift service set up for rabbitmq, e.g., `rabbitmq`
  - Outside the OpenShift cluster, set to the route you created in OpenShift
- Set `SECRET_KEY_BASE`, `SECRET_KEY`, `SECRET_TOKEN`, and `RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES` to arbitrary values (foo/bar/baz if you like) to set up the environment and actually serve pipeline assets.  TODO: figure out better solutions for these items.
- Inside the OpenShift cluster (or for any production instance, really), set Mongo environment variables:
  - `MONGOHQ_URL` to the OpenShift service set up for mongo, e.g., `mongodb`
  - `MONGODB_USER` and `MONGODB_PASSWORD` to the username and password for the mongo instance - they should be coming from secret key stores

# TODO
- ~~Investigate and write a health check script to ensure that the app is running~~
- [RabbitMQ tutorial scripts](https://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html) in a nice front end to show the following message patterns:
  - ~~Pub/Sub Fanout - done~~
  - Pub/Sub by Routing Key
  - Request/Response
  - On server startup, open Bunny connections to the RabbitMQ server based on existing subscriptions
  - When subscriptions are deleted, find and close the Bunny connections
- Demonstrate a simple communication with the [Synthea FHIR server](https://github.com/synthetichealth)
- Demonstrate a simple communication with the [Provider Screening Module](https://github.com/OpenTechStrategies/psm)
- Determine whether we can integrate portions of [Crucible FHIR server Testing](https://github.com/fhir-crucible/) into Poplin
